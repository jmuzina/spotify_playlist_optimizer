# Playlist Optimizer (Legacy)

Playlist Optimzer is an open-source web application that allows users to analyze their music listening preferences and create playlists accordingly. 

It was born out of a frequent issue I face; skipping song after song in Spotify playlists. When you have hundreds of songs in a playlist, it becomes overwhelming to remove songs you don't want to listen to anymore.

This is a na√Øve implementation I made when I was still very new to programming. I am currently [re-implementing this project](https://github.com/jmuzina/playlist_optimizer_frontend) with a more modern approach and a professional's programming experience.
